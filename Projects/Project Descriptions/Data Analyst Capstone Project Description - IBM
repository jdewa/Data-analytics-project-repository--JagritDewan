Project Descripton for IBM Data Analytics Capstone Project 
In this project, I took up a role of a Data Analyst with a fictional with a global IT and Business Services firm to collect and analyze several job posting and survey datasets to help identify trends for emerging technologies. 
I used the collected data and prepared it for analysis by using data wrangling techniques likes finding and removing duplicates, finding and inputting missing values. 
After cleaning the data, I applied statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify insights and trends like: 
   What are the top programming languages that are in demand? 
   What are the top database skills that are in demand? 
   What are the most popular IDEs? 
   And Demographic data like gender and age distribution of developers.
  Next, I used IBM cognos analytics to visualize and tell a story through the data I analyzed using charts, plots and histograms to help reveal my finding and trends. 
  Finally, I compiled all my analysis into a powerpoint and conveyed a story through it to my peers.
