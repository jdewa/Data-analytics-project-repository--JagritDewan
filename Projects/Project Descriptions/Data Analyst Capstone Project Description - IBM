Project Descripton for IBM Data Analytics Capstone Project 
In this project, I took up a role of a Data Analyst with a fictional with a global IT and Business Services firm to collect and analyze several job posting and survey datasets to help identify trends for emerging technologies. 
I used the collected data and prepared it for analysis by using data wrangling techniques likes finding and removing duplicates, finding and inputting missing values. 
After cleaning the data, I applied statistical techniques to analyze the data and identify insights and trends like: 
   1. What are the top programming languages that are in demand? 
   2. What are the top database skills that are in demand? 
   3. What are the most popular IDEs? 
  Next, I used IBM cognos analytics to visualize and tell a story through the data I analyzed using charts, plots and histograms to help reveal my finding and trends. 
  Finally, I compiled all my analysis into a powerpoint and conveyed a story through it to my peers.
