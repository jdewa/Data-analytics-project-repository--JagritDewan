Business Analytics Capstone Project Description 

In this project, I constructed a data-driven strategy for a fictional company, GYF (much like Yahoo) which provided a way to deal with the threat posed by adblocking software on the internet. 
To fully construct my strategy, I investigated and developed the following: 
1. Problem Statement: What problem(s) does adblocking software present to a firm like GYF in its ability to attract and maintain advertisement-buying customers?
2. A solution (strategy) to address the problem. 
3. The anticipated effects of the proposed solution/strategy. 
4. Metrics to measure the success of the strategy. 

NOTE: Slide 7 provides a solution to an application exercise: GYF has a robust training program. 
Two of its training programs are known as the “Hard Skills Program” and the “Soft Skills Program.” 
  Each of these trainings has two sub-programs: “External” (focusing on employee tasks mainly dealing with clients and customers outside GYF) and “Internal” (focusing on employee tasks mainly dealing with fellow GYF employees). 
  As the leader of the DATA team, you can enroll your employees in these training programs, but you must decide how to best allocate your training budget of $65,000 among these four training options (Hard Skills/External, Hard Skills/Internal, Soft Skills/External, and Soft Skills/Internal).

Technologies used: MS EXCEL, MS EXCEL Solver, MS PowerPoint
Skills Developed: Strategy-making, informed decision-making to drive profits and eliminate threats, critical-thinking
